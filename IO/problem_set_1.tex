\section*{Exercise 1}

\begin{itemize}
    \item We can interpret $\beta_{l}$ as the increase in production given an increase in labor, keeping prices fixed. Derivation in section~\ref{ex1.1}
    \item Now we need to assume that both inputs are flexible and static. This is totally unrealistic for capital, as it is quite unlikely that farmers invest in capital non-dynamically (tools/machines last periods, 1920..old technology, even more) and that can quickly adjust their levels of capital in the short run. I derive results in section~\ref{ex1.1}
    \item 
    
\end{itemize}

\section*{Exercise 2}

The moment condition are \[
    \mathbf{E}\left[\nu_{f,t}|\mathcal{I}_{f,t-1}\right]=0
    \]
    
Given the structure of the problem we can use $l_{f,t-1}, l_{f,t-2}\dots$ and $k_{f,t}, k_{f,t-1}\dots$ as instruments. 

Then we know that \(y_{f,t}= \beta_{0} + \beta_{l}l_{f,t}+ \beta_{k}k_{f,t}+\omega_{f,t}\), and we have the moments: 

\[
    \mathbf{E}\left[\hat{\omega_{f,t}}-\rho \hat{\omega_{f,t-1}}- \beta^{a}A_{f,t-1}|\mathcal{I}_{f,t-1}\right]=0
\]

Where we $\hat{\omega_{f,t}}=y_{f,t}- \beta_{0} + \beta_{l}l_{f,t}+ \beta_{k}k_{f,t}$
And we can estimate the following GMM: 

\[
\mathbf{E}\left[Z_{it-1} \otimes (\hat{\omega_{f,t}}-\rho \hat{\omega_{f,t-1}}- \beta^{a}A_{f,t-1})\right]=0
\]

where, given the assumptions of the exercise,  \(Z_{it-1}= \begin{pmatrix}
    1 \\
    l_{f,t-1} \\
    l_{f,t-2} \\
    k_{f,t} \\
    k_{f,t-1} 
\end{pmatrix}\)

It is important to include $\beta^{a}A_{f,t-1}$ in the moment function to support that $\mathbf{E}\left[\nu_{f,t}|\mathcal{I}_{f,t-1}\right]=0$. Mergers and acquisitions are not random events: high-productivity firms are more likely to acquire other firms, while low-productivity firms are more likely to be acquired. As a result, $A_{f,t-1}$ is correlated with past productivity and belongs to the firm information set at t-1, thus the previous condition does not hold. 

\textbf{B}
Estimated in the jupyter notebook. There is a problem of weak identification and GMM collapses to OLS\dots

\textbf{C}

The key assumption that we need to discuss is whether all inputs are substitutable or not. But now cotton clearly is not substitutable with labor or capital and this justifies the parametrization of the problem as a Leontieff model. (i.e cotton is not productive per se without labor or capital).

\section{Appendix}

\subsection*{1}
\label{ex1.1}
Under perfect competition and one mobile input only (labor) we have that the firm solves: 

\[
\begin{aligned}
\min_{L_{f,t},\,K_{f,t} \ge 0} 
&\; L_{f,t} W_{f,t} + K_{f,t} R_{f,t} \\
\text{s.t.} 
&\; \bar{Q}_{f,t}
= L_{f,t}^{\beta_l} K_{f,t}^{\beta_k} \Omega_{f,t}
\end{aligned}
\]

From the first order condition on labor:
\[
W_{f,t}=\lambda \beta_{l} \left(\frac{Q_{f,t}}{L_{f,t}}\right)
\]
By definition: $\mu_{f,t}=\frac{p_{f,t}}{\lambda_{f,t}}$
\[
W_{f,t}=\frac{p_{f,t}}{\mu_{f,t}} \beta_{l} \left(\frac{Q_{f,t}}{L_{f,t}}\right)
\]

Under perfect competition $\mu_{f,t}$=1, then rearranging we get:
\[
\beta_{l}= \frac{W_{f,t}L_{f,t}}{P_{f,t}Q_{f,t}}
\]

Which we can estimate with a simple average. 

\textbf{Text B}

From the same problem above, if we take first order conditions with respect to labor and capital we get: 

\(
W_{f,t}L_{f,t}=\lambda \beta_{l}(Q_{f,t})
\)

\(
R_{f,t}K_{f,t}=\lambda \beta_{k}(Q_{f,t})
\)

If we sum the two expressions: \(
W_{f,t}L_{f,t}+R_{f,t}K_{f,t}=\lambda \beta_{l}(Q_{f,t}) + \lambda \beta_{k}(Q_{f,t})
\)

which reduces to:

\(
W_{f,t}L_{f,t}+R_{f,t}K_{f,t}=\lambda Q_{f,t} 
\)

Then if we take 1 or 2 and divide by the same in both sides: 

\(
\frac{W_{f,t}L_{f,t}}{W_{f,t}L_{f,t}+R_{f,t}K_{f,t}}=\frac{\lambda \beta_{l}(Q_{f,t})}{\lambda Q_{f,t}}
\)

This simplifies: \(
\frac{W_{f,t}L_{f,t}}{W_{f,t}L_{f,t}+R_{f,t}K_{f,t}}=\beta_{l}
\)

Same argument for the other. The markup also comes from the expression from above:

\(
\lambda= \frac{W_{f,t}L_{f,t}}{Q_{f,t}\beta_{l}}
\)
If we substitute $\beta_{l}$ into this expression and we rearrange we have: 

\(
\lambda=\frac{W_{f,t}L_{f,t}+R_{f,t}K_{f,t}}{Q_{f,t}}
\)

Thus:
\(
\mu=\frac{pQ_{f,t}}{W_{f,t}L_{f,t}+R_{f,t}K_{f,t}}
\)
